# Welcome

This project is committed to promoting an atmosphere of hospitality. Whether you are new to open source software or this is yet another project you are considering, this project welcomes you! We recognize the inherent value, dignity, and worth of everyone who finds this project. You are invited to receive the benefits of it unconditionally. 

We also encourage you to (as you are comfortable) help with hosting this project as well. As you join the community, please take care to welcome people, graciously answer questions, and joyfully participate in discussions! Remember that hospitality is not always the most efficient way of doing things: take time to understand people when they are asking questions, even if it seems, “obvious”, “basic”, or something that’s already been covered in an FAQ.
