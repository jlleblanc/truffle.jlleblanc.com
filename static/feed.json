    "Reflection": "I drove to a park on Sunday and had one of these moments where I realize how the technology that's really worth it often takes the longest to mature. I got involved with podcasting back in late 2004, before iTunes even had a podcast directory. There were a handful of mostly experimental podcasts out there, many in the format of \"sorry I haven't podcasted in a while, here's an episode; sorry about the audio quality.\" There was no iPhone yet, and the idea was that you would have a piece of software that would sync episodes to a playlist in your iPod. My contribution to the community was a content management system plugin that generated RSS feeds with the <enclosure> tags that make podcasts work (even today.) Fast forward to Sunday, and I'm listening to Deborah Jian Lee interview Kate Bowler. I'm hit with a sense of awe and gratitude. I have a device in my pocket that effortlessly connects to my husband's car stereo and automatically plays interviews like this one. Podcasting has grown to the point that I now have to be selective about which ones I'm subscribed to! I no longer maintain the plugin I wrote (nor do I any longer use that CMS), but I know that for many years, it helped keep the community going. The software engineer in me wishes all of the software we write could be reusable, but the planner in me sees that all code is ultimately temporary. No code is truly wasted, if it contributes to a long term goal! All food for thought as I work on Truffle: my personal software project.",

I was introduced to a handout called “the genderbread man” (Google it, there’s a PDF), which helped my understanding quite a bit. But the most important thing I’ve learned is that we need to listen. There are a lot of gender identities and experiences that are grouped under the trans* umbrella, and it’s better to listen than assume. I know I haven’t always been the best at that, but I’m still learning and trying.",

    "Comment": "Been making this for small group dinner with my church. As always, these are rough estimates on portions, scale to taste. I might try adding chili paste in with the meat next time.",
    "Ingredients": [
      "2 lbs ground beef (grass fed makes a difference here)",
      "Fresh ginger",
      "1 T peanut oil (or other high temp oil)",
      "1/3 cup of hoisin based marinade (I've been using Soy Vay)",
      "3 medium to large carrots",
      "1 large cucumber",
      "1 bunch of cliantro",
      "2-3 cups of rice (dry)"
    ],
    "Recipe": "Start steaming your rice on before you start on the rest of the meal, especially if you're cooking brown rice. Peel and chop about a thumb's worth of ginger, then fry it in a large skillet with the oil. After 30-60 seconds, add the ground beef. Cook the beef until none of it is still visibly pink. At this point, drain the fat from the beef. Add the marinade to the beef and continue cooking on medium heat for 5 minutes, sirring constantly so it doesn't scortch. Meanwhile (or beforehand), prepare the fresh vegetables. Peel carrots and chop off the ends. Then using a veggie peeler or mandolin, peel long, thin strips of carrot. Peel, seed, quarter, and chop the cucumber into no thicker than 1/4 inch pieces. Rinse the cliantro (make sure you don't have any sand or dirt), chop off the ends before you get to the leaves, then break the rest of the stalks into thirds. Set out bowls: allow diners to fill a bottom layer of rice, followed by the beef, and then topped with the fresh vegetables. Also set out any condiments desired (e.g., sriracha, kimchi, chili sauce, etc...) Serves 6-8."

One reason is that it works more like a spectrum of personality: everyone's unique, but you tend to have one set of personality traits that are stronger than the others. Another reason is that the Enneagram shows how each personality picks up characteristics of another personality as they move towards health or stress. My Enneagram type is 1, also known as the Reformer or the Perfectionist. As I become more emotionally healthy, I move towards type 7 (the Enthusiast.) I'm finding that for me, the gateway towards 7 can come in the form of silliness! So I'm looking for more opportunities to practice silliness.

If the peak of both hit at the same time, we'll have a situation where there will be acres of under/unused commercial space, surrounded by extraneous parking lots (especially if driverless cars are used exclusively for Uber/Lyft-style services.) On one hand, this could create a situation where people just move farther away from cities and suburbs to avoid living near dead malls. On the other hand, a lot of those parking lots could become new housing and office space. It'll be interesting to see how all of this pans out.",

I've realized this isn't a hard and fast rule. Therefore, in Truffle it's possible to declare a tag with a first capital letter. (Or so we will see when this parses.)

His family has a tradition of eating cinnamon rolls, so he put some in the oven. He told me to check on them; when I did, they were raw and cold. My oven was dead. I started panicking. One of his coworkers texted \"let me know if you need anything\" to which he replied \"do you have a kitchen we can borrow?\" She did! As Andrew went to work, I packed all of our groceries in the car, drove over to his coworker's apartment, and made Thanksgiving dinner.

    "Comment": "I've sometimes said the thing that gets you hooked on programming is the moment you start getting more work out of a piece of code than what you put into it. However, a thought occurred to me today: instead of talking about the work I'm getting out of the code, what if I talked about the joy I'm getting out of it? The Truffle project is something I do in my spare time for no money. I don't believe I'll ever get rich off it, but there's certainly a lot of opportunity for joy. Part of what brings me joy is running the script that generates a \"blank\" truffle I can start filling. I'm making a point to start every session I work on Truffle with that joy!",
